Hey! I'm Ashish — welcome to my tiny, chaotic corner of the internet. Pull up a chair, pour yourself something decent to drink (chai, coffee, or whatever keeps you functional), and let’s keep this short and not too serious.

Who am I? Short answer: a developer who enjoys making things that mostly work and then writing a README so my future self doesn’t cry. Long answer: I tinker, I break things on purpose (for science), I fix them again, and I keep notes so I can pretend I meant to do it that way.

What you'll find here:
- half-finished projects that looked good at 2am
- tiny how‑tos I wish I’d found earlier
- nerdy rants about package managers, terminals, and the one dependency that refuses to cooperate
- the occasional neat trick that actually saves time

This isn't polished. It's not meant to be. Expect plain language, snippets that (probably) run, and honesty about what worked and what didn't. If I learned something the hard way, I'll save you the bruise.

Wanna talk? Collaborate? Tell me my code is trash? Drop a line at your-email@example.com (replace with a real one when you’re ready — or tell me here and I’ll update it). Or link to me on GitHub/Twitter/LinkedIn — whatever social thing you prefer.

Thanks for stopping by. I’ll try to update when I build or discover something worth shouting about. If not, at least the site exists and the footer year is right.

Cheers,  
Ashish
